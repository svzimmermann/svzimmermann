Welcome to my GitHub-Page. There isn't much there yet, though.
I have a personal interest in functional programming and a love
for cli applications and games.

## The lost principle of _KISS_

Keep it simple, stupid is most probably one of the most
important concepts of software engineering. It is, however,
forgotten more and more, even in the domain of open source
software. Follow it!

## Game recommendations
Some of the best and perhaps most complex games are actually
based on terminal output. My personal favourite is
[NetHack](https://www.nethack.org).
Also check out
[Rogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)), which is
more or less it's father (or mother, if you want).

## Literature recommendations
**Clean Code** from Robert C. Martin.
